# CASTOR Exposure Time Calculator (ETC)

FORECASTOR Team - 2022-2023

**This package is under active development. It should be stable but please let me know if
there are any bugs or unusual behaviour!**

This Python package is an exposure time calculator for
[CASTOR](https://www.castormission.org/). Since CASTOR is currently in Phase 0, this tool
contains tunable parameters that are not normally exposed in most other exposure time
calculators; the user is highly encouraged to read the docstrings and view the
[example notebooks](https://github.com/CASTOR-telescope/ETC_notebooks) prior to using this
software. Likewise, there may be frequent updates to this package as the mission matures
(see the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for more details).

## Launching on CANFAR

1. Ensure you have a Canadian Astronomy Data Centre account (or
   [request one](https://www.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/en/auth/request.html) if you
   do not have one yet).
2. Go to [CANFAR](https://www.canfar.net/en/) and sign in to the
   [Science Portal](https://www.canfar.net/science-portal/). If you cannot access this,
   then you must send an email to [support@canfar.net](mailto:support@canfar.net)
   requesting access to the Science Portal.
3. Inside the [Science Portal](https://www.canfar.net/science-portal/), click the "`+`"
   icon to launch a new session. Under "`type`", select "`notebook`". If multiple
   `castor_etc` versions are available, you can select the specific version you would like
   to use under the "`container image`" field. The version number is denoted by the string
   following the colon (e.g., `images.canfar.net/castor/castor_etc:1.0.0` means version
   `1.0.0` of the `castor_etc` notebook image).
4. Assign a name to your Jupyter notebook container and choose the maximum amount of
   memory (RAM) and maximum number of CPU cores you would like to have available for your
   notebook container. Note that RAM and CPU are shared resources. A reasonable amount to
   use, for example, would be 16 GB of RAM and 4 CPU cores. Larger RAM and CPU requests
   are not uncommon, but please be mindful of others using the Science Portal.
5. Click the blue "`Launch`" button to start your new `castor_etc` notebook session. It
   can take up to a minute to launch the session depending on which computing node you are
   assigned to and the last time the image was launched. Additionally, only 1 session of
   each type is allowed at a time and they automatically shut down after 14 consecutive
   days.
6. The [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) environment is set up to work "out of the box"
   with the `castor_etc` Python package. You do not need to install the `castor_etc`
   package separately; everything is running inside a
   [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment. In addition to `LaTeX`, other
   convenience tools like `git` are preloaded as well. Feel free to suggest any changes to
   the default configuration.

## Installation

If you do not wish to clone the repository, the easiest way to install the `castor_etc`
package is via:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/CASTOR-telescope/ETC.git
```

Note that executing this command in a conda environment (i.e., by building from the
[environment file](docker/castor_etc_env.yml)) is recommended.

Alternatively, after cloning this repository via:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CASTOR-telescope/ETC.git
```

You can then install the ETC package using one of the following commands, which should be
executed within the repository folder (i.e., `ETC/`).

To install the `castor_etc` package "normally", use either:

```bash
pip install .
```

or

```bash
python setup.py install
```

If you want to install in
[develop mode](https://pip-python3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install.html#install-editable),
use:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

In develop mode, the installation of the package simply links back to the
[`castor_etc`](castor_etc/) folder itself, meaning any changes made to this package will
be reflected in your environment.

## Known Issues

- Rectangular aperture sometimes produces the incorrect number of pixels in the photometry
  aperture. I believe this is actually a bug in `astropy` since the elliptical aperture
  does not suffer from this problem and the aperture weights are clearly wrong (see the
  photometry source code for an example that highlights this flaw).
  - The package will raise a warning when the number of aperture pixels is incorrect
    (i.e., when it deviates by more than 0.1 pixels from the true value). When this
    happens, either slightly change the aperture dimensions or avoid using the rectangular
    aperture for now.

## Roadmap

Here are some future plans for the ETC:

- Use a sampled PSF to create a pixel-based kernel to convolve with the simulated images.
  Additionally, point sources should use the sampled PSF to calculate its encircled energy
  (we currently assume the point source PSF is a Gaussian).
- Add slitless grism and multi-object spectroscopic capabilities to the ETC
- Arbitrary source profiles (i.e., surface brightness profiles) based on a FITS file
  _with_ spectrum? Not sure what I would be asking the user for in this case (e.g., what
  unit should the FITS file data be in?)... Please let me know if you have any ideas!
- Support simulating multiple sources within the same aperture (e.g., a point source on
  top of a galaxy).
- Make unit tests and implement continuous integration.

Important: do not hesitate to reach out (using one of the methods detailed
[below](#questions-issues-suggestions-and-other-feedback)) if there are any features you
would like the ETC to have. This tool is meant to be used by the community, after all!
